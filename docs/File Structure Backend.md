### **1. `src/main/java/com/zerox/csm/`**
This is the **root package** for your Spring Boot application where all the core Java classes reside.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `config/`**  
- **Purpose**: Holds configuration files related to your applicationâ€™s settings.  
- **Classes**:  
  - **`SecurityConfig`**: Configuration class for setting up security, such as **Spring Security** and **JWT** token handling. This file is crucial for securing your application and defining how users authenticate and gain access.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `controllers/`**  
- **Purpose**: Contains your **REST API controllers** that handle HTTP requests and return responses.  
- **Classes**:  
  - **`AuthController`**: Handles user authentication-related endpoints like login, registration, etc. It might include methods for generating JWT tokens or other user-related operations.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `dto/`**  
- **Purpose**: Contains **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**. These are simple objects that carry data between processes, often used to transfer data from the backend to the frontend.  
  - **Example:** DTOs could contain user login details or product data in a simplified form.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `exception/`**  
- **Purpose**: This folder likely contains custom **exception handling classes**. In a Spring Boot app, this is useful for managing application errors gracefully and returning meaningful responses to the frontend.
  - **Example:** Custom exceptions for resource not found or unauthorized access could be here.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `model/`**  
- **Purpose**: Holds the **JPA entity models** (representing the tables in your database) and **domain objects**. This is where the main business logic is represented in terms of entities.  
  - **Example:** Models could include `User`, `Product`, `Order`, etc., and they are annotated with **JPA** annotations like `@Entity`, `@Id`, etc.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `repository/`**  
- **Purpose**: Contains **repositories** that extend Spring Data JPA or MongoDB interfaces to interact with the database.  
  - **Example:** Repository classes like `UserRepository`, `ProductRepository`, etc., will handle CRUD operations for each model class.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `security/`**  
- **Purpose**: Contains classes related to **security functionality**, like JWT token utilities, authentication, and authorization logic.  
- **Classes**:  
  - **`JwtUtils`**: A utility class for **JWT token management**. It might have methods for generating, parsing, and validating JWT tokens. This is essential for securing REST APIs.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `service/`**  
- **Purpose**: Contains **service classes** that encapsulate the business logic of your application. This is the layer between the controller (API layer) and the repository (data layer).  
- **Classes**:  
  - **`CsmApplication`**: This class might be the main application class that runs the Spring Boot application, typically containing the `main()` method annotated with `@SpringBootApplication`.

### **2. `src/main/resources/`**
This is the **resources directory** where external files, configuration files, and static resources reside.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `static/`**  
- **Purpose**: Contains static files such as images, CSS, JavaScript files, and other assets that can be directly served to the client.  
  - **Example:** Static resources like `logo.png`, `style.css`, etc., could be placed here.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `templates/`**  
- **Purpose**: Holds **templates** like Thymeleaf templates or JSP pages, if you're using server-side rendering in your application.  
  - **Example:** Files like `login.html`, `index.html`, etc., would go here if you use Thymeleaf.

#### **ðŸ“‚ `application.properties`**  
- **Purpose**: Contains your application's **configuration properties**, such as database settings, server port, logging levels, and other environment-specific properties.  
  - **Example**:  
    ```properties
    server.port=8080
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
    spring.security.jwt.secret=your-secret-key
    ```

### **3. `src/test/`**
This is where **test classes** will reside. Spring Boot will automatically recognize this folder for unit and integration tests.
